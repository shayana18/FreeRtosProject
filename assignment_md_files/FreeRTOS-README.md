Introduction
===
In this programming activity you will extend an industry standard Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), namely FreeRTOS, to support task-dynamic priority scheduling and resource access control. The following are some goals for this assignment:

* Understand the architecture and design choices behind a real-time operating system kernel;
* Extend the capabilities of the RTOS kernel;
* Gain an appreciation for the challenges of embedded software development;
* Improve upon work of others by examining prior engineering choices;
* Design and implement techniques for testing your modifications to the kernel.

# [Task 1] EDF support
Extend the scheduler to support EDF. You need to support
_constrained-deadline_ systems where relative deadline D<sub>i</sub> is smaller
than or equal to time period < T<sub>i</sub>. Implement admission control in
the kernel, and provide the ability to accept new tasks as the system is
running. 
If the task set is constrained-deadline, then you will have to carry out
_exact_ EDF analysis (processor demand) to decide schedulability. Otherwise
(i.e., implicit-deadline), of course one would use the LL bound since it is
sufficient and necessary. 

You may use your `printk()` (after modification to use the UART implementation
of the FreeRTOS port) to debug your scheduler. It is crucial that you
demonstrate that the schedules produced are indeed EDF. Some messages printed
to the console using your `printk()` should suffice. 

Also one has to deal with the situation when a deadline-miss occurs (transient
overload). The  overrun management mechanism is left to you as design choice.
Would you drop the late job? Make it the lowest priority? Or restart the system
altogether? Document your design choices clearly. 

Indicate all the changes that you made to FreeRTOS in order to support EDF. 
Document all the changes in a README as well.

In a configuration file, expose some configurable constants that can be used by
the user to enable/disable EDF and/or SRP. If the user chooses not to use your
extensions to FreeRTOS, you should instead run the default mechanisms provided
by FreeRTOS.

**Testing**: To see the difference in performance between the processor demand
analysis and the LL bound, you may perform admission control on roughly 100 periodic 
tasks running simultaneously.  

# [Task 2] Stack-based resource-access control (SRP)
To support resource sharing with the EDF scheduler, extend the semaphore
implementation of FreeRTOS to use SRP. You only need to extend FreeRTOS with
SRP for 
_binary semaphores_. The resource access protocol used in FreeRTOS is the
Priority Inheritance Protocol.

Also extend the admission control tests developed in the previous part to
include blocking times and test schedulability using EDF + SRP. It is up to you
to decide how the worst-case estimates of the lengths of the critical sections
are given to the scheduler.

**Hint:** You may want to utilize a stack (in the kernel) to keep track of the 
system ceiling and its evolution.

One of the consequences of using SRP is the ability to share the **run-time
stack** (which is different from the stack used to implement SRP). Recall that
each 
process must have a private run-time stack space, sufficient to store its
context (the content of the CPU registers) and its local variables. Observe
that in 
SRP, if two tasks have the same preemption level, they can never occupy stack 
space at the same time. Thus, the space used by one such task can be "reused"
by the other, eliminating the need to allocate two separate stack spaces, one
for each task, even if both are active (ready for execution). This is a
consequence of the fact that in SRP, once a task starts execution, it can never
blocked on any resources. Note that the storage savings resulting from sharing
the run-time stack become more substantial as the number of tasks with the same
preemption level increase. _In your implementation of SRP, provide support for
sharing the run-time stack among the running tasks._ Read section 7.8.5 of the 
text, as well [T.P. Baker's paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/128747/)
on SRP for more details.

Again, develop suitable tests to demonstrate that your implementation of SRP 
and stack sharing are correct. To see the savings we reap as a result of
sharing the run-time stack, carry out a quantitative study with stack sharing
vs. no stack sharing. Report the gains in terms of the maximum run-time stack
storage used. It is sufficient to run 100 tasks simultaneously for your
quantitative analysis. 

# [Task 3] Constant Bandwidth Server (CBS) Support

You will add support for servicing aperiodic, soft real-time requests alongside hard real-time tasks, by implementing reservation-based, dynamic server schemes for handling aperiodic tasks, on top of EDF. You will be using your EDF implementation from the previous programming assignment.

Read the chapter on Dynamic Priority Servers in the text (chapter 7). In essence, CBS allows tasks that exceed their nominal CPU reserve to continue execution, or stay in the ready queue, by postponing the deadline of the task. FreeRTOS provides methods for creating and managing periodic tasks. For this project, add a new type of task that would be managed by a constant bandwidth server. Creating a task that is managed by a CBS would be similar to creating a regular periodic task.
 
 Add the primitives needed to manage constant bandwidth servers at the programming interface and within the kernel/scheduler. It is possible to have multiple CBS tasks running concurrently. A software developer should be able to build an application that uses a combination of regular periodic tasks and constant bandwidth servers. Tasks are scheduled using EDF. Remember that priority ties are always broken in favor of the server. To simplify matters, you may assume that a job of a task is not released until the previous job of the same task is complete.

# [Task 4] Supporting Multiprocessor Real-time Scheduling in FreeRTOS

In this part you will implement both partitioned and global EDF. You will be considering only _implicit-deadline_ periodic tasks. The different multiprocessor scheduling approaches (partitioned vs. global) pose different classes of challenges, both theoretically and implementation-wise, and the goal of this part is to learn the algorithmic complexities of multiprocessor scheduling, as well as gain an understanding and appreciation of the practical issues and challenges related to supporting multiprocessor execution and scheduling.

Our platform contains two identical cores, so we will be considering the _identical machine_ multiprocessor model. In computer architecture, this is called the Symmetric MultiProcessor (SMP) architecture. In the case of multi-core processors, the SMP architecture applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors. SMP systems are tightly coupled multiprocessor systems with a pool of homogeneous processors running independently of each other. Each processor, executing different programs and working on different sets of data, has the capability of sharing common resources (memory, I/O device, interrupt system and so on) that are connected using a system bus or a crossbar. 

The following source is a really good starting point: [Introduction to Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) with FreeRTOS](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-SMP-Demos/blob/main/SMP.md). Earlier, as there was no multiprocessing support at all for FreeRTOS, students had to work their way up from the ARM processor data sheets. With the SMP support now, this task should be a lot easier!

Your solution should include the ability to specify the core on which a task runs, remove a task from a processor, or change the processor upon which the task is running (migration), etc. You may expose as many (programming) interfaces in order to complete this task in the cleanest possible way. Among the things that you should be thinking about are:

1. Interrupt handling and timer functionality: Do we need a single interrupt controller/timer per core or is one shared interrupt controller/timer sufficient? 
2. How to stop/start each core;
3. Dispatching tasks to certain cores, as well as task migration across cores;
4. Do you need a separate scheduler per core in partitioned scheduling? Is the
   situation different in global scheduling? 

You need not worry about resource sharing, nor do you need to worry about inter-task communication. You may assume that the tasks are independent and do not share resources.

The kernel itself is a task, so the decision of which 
core runs the kernel task at any time should be considered in any 
multiprocessor scheduling scheme. One option is to always execute the kernel 
on core 0 so that it is pinned to that core forever, even in global scheduling. Another is to treat the kernel as purely an "interrupt-handler", where it is invoked in response to a service request and will run on the core from which the request originated. 

In contrast to partitioned scheduling, global scheduling permits task migration (i.e., different jobs of an individual task may execute upon different 
processors), as well as job-migration: An individual job that is preempted may resume execution upon a different processor from the one upon which it had been executing prior to preemption. Thus, for global EDF scheduling, a single ready queue is maintained for all tasks and processors. Tasks are inserted into the global queue in EDF order, and 
the job at the head of the ready queue is dispatched to any processor. 

Implement partitioned and global EDF and add all the required support in FreeRTOS. Also add a simple admission control test of your choice. Expose configuration variables to allow the user to choose which multiprocessor scheduling strategy should be used. Your partitioned and global EDF should co-exist in the kernel's code base (but not active simultaneously), and the user should merely activate any by defining the proper constant (`GLOBAL_EDF_ENABLE`, `PARTITIONED_EDF_ENABLE`). If no multi-core scheduling algorithm is specified by the user, make global EDF the default scheduler.
